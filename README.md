#Distinguish between Binary Search, a binary tree, and a binary search tree.

A binary search is used when a well-ordered set of data exists in an array. The binary search starts in the center of the data set and evaluates whether the value searched for is smaller or larger than the current value. The search continues in the half of the set that the value searched for would be until it is found. 

A binary tree is a set of data with which each parent node can have either a left node, right node, both, or neither. 

A binary search tree is a regular binary tree that is well-ordered.
